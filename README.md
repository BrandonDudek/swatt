SWAT (pronounced \\swÃ¤t\\) is a library of Tools to help Software Testers quickly and efficiently Automate their Test Suites.

## Library Table of Contents (Packages)
* Asserts
  * Contains custom Assertions that can be commonly used.
* Exceptions
  * Contains custom Runtime Exceptions used by the SWATT library.
  * All of the Exception have a common ancestor, for easy catching. 
* Selenium
  * These tools will help with testing Web Apps.
  * It is configured to work with the latest version of Chrome and Firefox version 59.0.1.
  * Has been tested on windows 7 and MacOS 10.13, but should work on similar systems.
  * **Sample Project** [swatt-selenium-sample-project](https://github.com/BrandonDudek/swatt-selenium-sample-project)
* String
  * A Helper class to preform common and/or complex String manipulations.
  * Is **very** helpful for Whitespace manipulation and Character Sets.

## Class Types
This library contains 3 basic types of classes to assist you in your Automated Testing Efforts.
* Helper Classes
  * Helper classes are meant to help you work with an existing Class, Library, or File Type
  * However, they do **not** contain all of the functionality needed. You may still need to use other classes for 
  some functionality.
* Utility (Util) Classes
  * Utility Classes will help you perform certain Functions
  * Each class will contain a related group of functions 
* Wrapper Classes
  * Wrapper Classes are also meant to help you work with an existing Class or File Type
  * It should be used as a replacement for the Class that it "wraps"
  * You will interact with these Wrapper Classes directly and not with the Classes that they "wrap"
  
## Assumptions / Technologies Used
This library is built with the assumptions that you will be using the following technologies:
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
  * For dependency resolution. 
* [Jackson (FasterXML version)](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
  * For JSON and XML mapping.
* [Log4J (version 2)](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)
  * For Logging.
* [Saxon-HE](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/)
  * For XPath querying.
* [TestNG](http://testng.org/)
  * For Unit Tests.

Usage of conflicting technologies may result in unexpected and undesired behavior.

## Logging
Every class in this library logs with the Log4J library.
And all of them follow this standard:
* Public Methods
  * Has an INFO level "[START]" log
  * Has a DEBUG level "[END]" log
  * Any other logs in the method are at the DEBUG or TRACE level
  * _Note:_ WARNING logs may also be present, but **Exceptions** will be thrown instead of logging ERRORs
* Protected / Package-Private / Private Methods
  * Has a DEBUG level "[START]" log
  * Has a TRACE level "[END]" log
  * Any other logs in the method are at the TRACE level
  * _Note:_ WARNING logs may also be present, but **Exceptions** will be thrown instead of logging ERRORs

## Contributing
* Feel free to report any bugs you may find or any improvement that you may want.
  * (The whole point of this Library is collaboration.)
* If you would like to write code to fix bugs or add functionality, we also encourage that! ðŸ˜Š
  * We only ask that you adhere to the following Rules.

## Coding Contribution Rules
* Set your git project user to your GitHub Username and Email address
  * At your root project directory, in Command Prompt / Terminal enter:
    * `git config user.name "YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME"`
    * `git config user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL_ADDRESS"`
  * To validate you changes, enter: `git config --list`
* Do all of your changes in a new branch
* Use Merge Requests to push your changes to the **master** branch
* Follow the [Logging](#logging) standards.
* Add **full** Javadocs to all Public Classes, Methods, Enums, etc.
* Add your `@author` tag to any code section that you edited.
  * In the format: `@author Name Here (<a href="github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME">GITHUB_USERNAME</a>)`
    * i.e. `@author Brandon Dudek (<a href="github.com/BrandonDudek">BrandonDudek</a>)`
